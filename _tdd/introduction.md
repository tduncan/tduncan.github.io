Developed by [Kent Beck] in the late 1990s, Test Driven Development is a disciplined process of creating software by 
first specifying the desired behavior in the form of a failing automated test. The process consists of three simple 
steps:

1. Write a failing test
2. Make the test pass
3. Make the code clean.

These three steps have come to be referred to as **Red**, **Green**, **Refactor**.

Test Driven Development is more than just a process for developing code; it is a framework for approaching problems and
building solutions to those problems. It enables immediate and reliable feedback, inspires confidence when making 
changes, invites experimentation, and grants its practitioners freedom to explore safely.

It is not easy, however. It is a discipline, a skill that must be honed through practice. As with any skill, the
initial learning curve can be difficult, but the payoff for sticking with it is huge.
