Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm a software engineer currently living and working in the 
San Francisco Bay Area.  Super unique, right?  Before finding
my way to the Bay I spent the first 3 decades of my life in the
Midwest of the United States.

I found software later than many of my peers.  I didn't write
my first line of code until college, but the experience was 
life changing, literally.  In less than a year I went from an
18-year-old planning on spending at least the next 4 years
playing college soccer to choosing to major in Computer Science
and pursuing a career in software engineering.

Here you will find me writing about Java and related technologies,
as well as more process-oriented topics like
test driven development (TDD).  My approach to producing software
has been influenced a great deal by the 
[eXtreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)
community, individuals like [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/),
[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), 
and [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/), as well as through
my own practice of the ideas taken from those inspirations.
My hope is that I can share those experiences with you, and with
any luck perhaps a little inspiration.
