#### Dispensables
Dispensable code is unnecessary and can generally be safely removed. The result is a leaner, easier to navigate and
understand codebase.

##### [Dead Code](/code-smells/dispensables/dead-code/)
Dead code is code that is no longer referenced by other parts of the production codebase, often because it has been made
obsolete.
